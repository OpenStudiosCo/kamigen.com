  PANEL 1
    The airlock behind Jack is slowly opening, but not at the normal speed the doors would open if the system was doing it.

    RYOKO
      How are they compatible?

    Ryoko is shocked that not only do their space suits look alike, Jack is suggesting they can easily swap power sources.

    JACK
      Stand over here for me will you?

  PANEL 2
    The airlock behind Jack is now halfway open and an approaching figure in the distance begins to call his name.
    
    HELIOS STATION A.I.
      Launching escape pod!

    WERP
      Jaaaack...

    RYOKO
      Wait! No!

  NOTES
    A missing in between panel here is Jack pressing a button and the escape pod hatch slamming down on Ryoko, which is they have different backgrounds in the second panel.
