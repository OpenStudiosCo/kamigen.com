  PANEL 1
    A wireframe of the Earth being struck by a water comet and torrents of water slowly gushing down on the planet from a vapour cloud in space.

    NARRATOR
      April 2077, the month a water comet came too close and left several oceans of water in our sky.

    NARRATOR
      100 years from that day, even the highest mountains would be underwater.

  NOTES
    I knew I wanted to flood the Earth for this story but apparently there's not enough water here to do it so I opted to hurl a water ball at us.
