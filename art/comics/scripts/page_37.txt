  PANEL 1
    Surrounded by the debris of her shredded spacecraft, Ryoko is alone in space floating over the Earth.

    RYOKO / NARRATOR
      I'm Ryoko. They said I was paranoid, putting on a suit for this journey.

    RYOKO / NARRATOR
      Now if I don't find a way to get to the moon, the human race will go extinct!

  NOTES
    It's not clear in this single panel but the debris that destroyed the spacecraft has already quickly moved on from this area.
