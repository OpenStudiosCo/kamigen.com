    Jim's aircraft is leaving a vapour trail across the Kamigen sky, an eagle and a monkey can be seen closer to the tree line, which is mostly coconut palms.

    JIM / NARRATOR
      The bounty for the monster I'm hunting will get me legs.

  PANEL 2
    The mission Jim is currently on is seen, it is clear he's a mercenary for hire. An elongated mutant nautilus is pictured in the report, indicating it is the kill target.

  NOTES
    I really wanted to have a bottom looking up perspective from the jungle but I had no idea how to draw that so I drew a treetop view of him passing overhead. The mission brief is my first use of this story telling format in the comic.
