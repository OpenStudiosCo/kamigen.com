    LUNAR SURVEY REPORT
      Geological: Huge new fissures across entire lunar surface.
      Chemical: All the helium is gone.
      Nuclear: Irradiated carbon points to massive helium flash, matches mass lost
      Closing:
        A force beyond our comprehension is causing the moon to act as an interstellar water magnet. Recommend urgent study.
