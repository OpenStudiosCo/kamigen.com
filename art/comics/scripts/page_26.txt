  PANEL 1
    The President is satisfied that the henchman (Tom) will take care of things, since he is an accomplished and trustworthy person from her perspective. She decides to end the meeting and begins to leave the room.

    PRESIDENT SERENA BARBATE
      Good. I know I can trust you Tom.

    NARRATOR
      Seriously, he's the "bad guy" from a few pages back.

  NOTES
    Like all good leaders, President Barbate has a lot of trust in her fellow council members who also act as her advisors. Unfortunately in this case, as Jim's narration confirms, Tom's the bad guy.
