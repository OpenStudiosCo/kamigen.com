  PANEL 1
    Three symbols are shown - an assault rifle surrounded by skulls representing conflict and death, a child and parent playing representing the cycle of life and a guitar surrounded by floating notes, representing the culture and way of life that emerged on the sea.

    NARRATOR
      And from the stories passed down by our ancestors at sea.

  PANEL 2
    The titular island is pictured, at the moment of it's discovery. Ships from across the planet flock to Kamigen Island to see the miracle and new hope.

    NARRATOR
      After centuries of living on the water, a volcanic miracle... Kamigen... changed everything.

  NOTES
    For anyone keeping track, approximately two centuries have passed since "April 2077" - but I have not decided an exact timeline as yet. Kamigen island would be composed of a vast amount of lava to have surfaced from the drowned Earth in this story.
