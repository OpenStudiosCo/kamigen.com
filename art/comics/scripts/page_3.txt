    The infamous moon landing is pictured with the Earth hovering over it in the background. An American astronaut is planting the flag on the moon's surface.

    NARRATOR
      In ancient times, the moon was dusty, grey and its' only water ran beneath the surface.

    NARRATOR
      You could even land there and walk around safely.

  NOTES
    My favourite moment in human history just had to be in here, what an achievement for our species!
