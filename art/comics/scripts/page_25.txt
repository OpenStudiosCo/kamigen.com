  PANEL 1
    The henchman from the previous scene is seen in the shadows and addresses the frustrated leader. It's clear he is on this political council as her colleague.

    HENCHMAN
      President Barbate, contain yourself.

  PANEL 2
    The henchman's facial features are revealed. He is a fair skinned man with glasses and long black hair.

    HENCHMAN
      There is no need to panic. I will lead our shared intel efforts to find the truth.

    NARRATOR
      Idiots.

  NOTES
    The evil henchman's face is revealed but it wasn't immediately clear that that's who he was so I threw in some exposition from the narrator. My intention is to have the narrator of each issue actually be the cover character, but it's a little bit unclear to me when and how Jim would be retelling this story (for now!).
