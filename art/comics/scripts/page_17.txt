  PANEL 1
    The camera centers on the remains of the Heavy Nautilus, its giant shell and tentacles still partially intact and recognisable from afar.

    SYSTEM ALERT
      Kill confirmed.

    SYSTEM ALERT
      Main power online.

  NOTES
    The carcass depicted here would be at least 50 metres long meaning that its ability to turn off power generation combined with its natural armour and massive size make it a threat to anything manmade at sea.
