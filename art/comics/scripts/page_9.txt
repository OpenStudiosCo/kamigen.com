  PANEL 1
    Jim is at his favourite prosthetics store - NextLimbs. It's a small boutique popup store on the beach, built using natural materials and with construction techniques that don't impact the local ecology.

      The cheapest pair that'll fit an aircraft sea is 60,000. I'm sorry Jim.

    JIM
      It's OK Gordon, I understand.

  NOTES
    I was very apprehensive about introducing money into this futuristic world but I figured that perhaps a wheel based prosthetic might be free but advanced cyborg legs that are fit for an aircraft may have a cost to obtain - regardless of whether it was money or some other obstacle/system.
