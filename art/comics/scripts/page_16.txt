  PANEL 1
    A wide shot of Jim's falling aircraft firing off a missile at the Heavy Nautilus and managing a direct hit.

    SYSTEM ALERT
      Missiles away!

  NOTES
    It may not be clear but Jim's aircraft is actually still falling too fast to recover without engines, he was barely able to get enough power to manouvre into a target lock and fire the missiles.
