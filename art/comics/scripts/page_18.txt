  PANEL 1
    Jim's aircraft is once again flying at full speed, center stage heading back to Kamigen island. The island is clearly visible in the distance.

    JIM / NARRATOR
      Time to go home.

  PANEL 2
    Jim is at a clothing store trying on some clothes in a mirror.

    JIM / NARRATOR
      I haven't worn pants in years...

  NOTES
    The top panel is another scene I wanted to do from a different angle but settled for this one as it was suitable for the assets at hand. In future I'll look find a way to re-use the 2D assets I have from different perspective.
