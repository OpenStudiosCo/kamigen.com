  PANEL 1
    Jim is lying on a hammock on the beach of Kamigen, a family of tortoises is walking by, the sun is setting and a fighter aircraft can be seen in the background.

    JIM / NARRATOR
      That's enough history... welcome to Kamigen Island!

  NOTES
    Introducing Jim - one of the main characters and narrators of this story. It should be quite apparent when the narration switches to another character later on but feel free to let me know if it isn't!
