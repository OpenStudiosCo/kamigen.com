  PANEL 1
    Silhouettes of fewer people than originally shown in Issue 1, depicting the reduced population in the Kamigen setting.

    RYOKO / NARRATOR
      Ten million lives are counting on this mission.

  PANEL 2
    The cockpit window of the spacecraft the scientists are on is shattered by space debris. The moon is seen in the distance as air leaks out and the ship begins to fall apart from other debris impacts.
  
    RYOKO / NARRATOR
      Before we hit that space debris, I really thought we had a chance.

  NOTES
    The second panel here needs a bit more setup elaborating on the people embarking on this mission and introducing a few of Ryoko's colleagues that perish here to give the scene more weight.
