  PANEL 1
    Jim is seen heading home as the sun sets over the Kamigen beach. His shadow moves amongst the canopy of palm tree shadows.

    JIM / NARRATOR
      It's weird being a cyborg, I was never for or against the idea.

  NOTES
    This scene started out with roads and buildings but I made a conscious decision to leave the island largely undeveloped for a later story. Kamigen island is a sacred habitat for the humans who live on nearby ships and floating cities.
