  PANEL 1
    The Earth pictured from outer space.

    NARRATOR
      Once upon a time, this planet had many lands.

  PANEL 2
    Silhouettes of various people, mainly families, living their lives on Earth at this time.

    NARRATOR
      Upon which billions lived.

  NOTES
    I wanted to start the story like a fairy tale to setup the kind of narrator the reader is dealing with (one that thinks he's being funny)
