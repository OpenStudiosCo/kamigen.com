  PANEL 1
    Looking out from Ryoko's space helmet and digital overlay, we see the space of a man made structure in the distance.

    SPACE SUIT ALERT
      IFF Signature Detected. Sending SOS...

    RYOKO / NARRATOR
      Is that a... a spacecraft? But we just lost the only one...

  PANEL 2
    A beam of energy from the space station has ensnared Ryoko and begins pulling her in.
    
    RYOKO / NARRATOR
      No... that's a space station! And now it's pulling me in!

  NOTES
    The space mission Ryoko was on was the first one in generations so there shouldn't be a space station up here, according to her perspective.
