  PANEL 1
    The silhouette of a mysterious henchman stands in a doorway, addressing his boss who has a cyborg hand and is stroking his pet cat.

    HENCHMAN
      M'lord, the Nautilus has been destroyed!

    BOSS
      How!

  NOTES
    Jim's nemesis has a cyborg hand and a cat. Older fans may recognise this as Claw from Inspector Gadget, but it isn't.
