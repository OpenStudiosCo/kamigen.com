  PANEL 1
    Jim is seen on his own on the beach, staring out as seemingly every living creature on the island is enjoying romantic bliss.

    There are multiple snakes, tortoises, beetles, crabs, monkeys, whales, dolphins and eagles all falling in love as Jim watches on in despair.

  NOTES
    Originally conceived as multiple panels, I wanted to show a personal and vulnerable side of Jim beyond his physical injury. In the end, it seemed funniest and simplest to just have animals coupling around him.
