  PANEL 1
    Having boarded the space station unwillingly, Ryoko is greeted by a cheerful stranger in an orange mirror of her own space suit.

    JACK
      Welcome to Helios Station! Sorry... Trust me. I can't explain any of what I'm about to do... we're both out of time.

  PANEL 2
    A close up of Jack reveals his name badge and the Helios Station badge. The station's symbol is an icon of the sun.

    JACK
      Your space suit's fusion generator... swap with me... Mine's renewable.

  NOTES
    Jack is in possession of langenium, which is a unique artificial mineral that can emit electricity with accumulated sunlight. Ryoko's suit has a deuterium power source.
