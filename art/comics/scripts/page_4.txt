PAGE 4

  PANEL 1
    The wealthy and powerful are building spacecraft to leave the cataclysm on Earth behind. Military forces guard the spacecraft and arrest protestors and refugees begging to escape the planet.

    NARRATOR
      The "really important" people found a new planet and left.

  PANEL 2
    Children onboard a sea vessel wave to the departing scores of space craft, not knowing the heart break their parents generation feels at this moment.

    NARRATOR
      We are the descendants of the people they left behind.

  NOTES
    This was a really challenging page in the early days of producing the comic - there were so many elements that I kept playing with to try to make the perspective work while also telling the visual story I wanted to.
