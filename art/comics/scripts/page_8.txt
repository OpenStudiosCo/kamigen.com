  PANEL 1
    Jim is now at a bar having some red wine, monkeys are bothering him for some of the bar nuts on the counter. Outside the hammock, it's clear Jim has no legs and the prosthesis he currently uses is an advanced cybernetic unicycle.

    JIM / NARRATOR
      I'm Jim, you may have noticed I have no legs.

  PANEL 2
    In a flashback to Jim's younger adult self, we see his body fully intact as he happily explores a virtual safari environment.

    JIM / NARRATOR
      But I wasn't always this cool.

  PANEL 3
    A crashed helicopter is pictured, upside down and in a pile of broken palm trees. It's clear Jim was piloting and crashed.

    JIM / NARRATOR
      I used to be a lousy pilot too.

  NOTES
    I initially couldn't be bothered finding legs to give Jim for the previous hammock page and just ran with it in the story. It worked better than I expected and allowed me to work in a bit of pain to an otherwise overly cheerful character.
